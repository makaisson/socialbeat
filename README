= SocialBeat

A proof of concept social crowd beat visualization thing, inspired by Giles Bowkett's RubyFringe talk.

Only works on OSX, maybe only on Leopard

= Install

  /usr/bin/gem install ruby-opengl # Note the use of system ruby (not ports or anything). Needed for rbcoremidi.

= Usage

  # Start archaeopteryx 
  # Open MIDI Patch Bay.app
  # Create a new input ("Archaeopteryx")
  # Create a new output ("SocialBeat")

  /usr/bin/ruby run.rb artists/simple.rb
  vim artist/simple.rb # Try changing the base_color and watch it morph on the fly. oooooooooh.

= Current state

  DONE
  * Hot reloads your artist file
  * Accepts MIDI input

  TODO  
  * Pretty much everything
  * Canvas::OpenGl needs to be fleshed out so you can actually draw cool stuff

= Architecture

  A subclass of SocialBeat::Artist is instantiated on the fly, as the code file changes.
  This instance is responsible for drawing and update logic. It is totally stateless - any state it wishes to
  keep should be stored in the env variable that is passed to it by SocialBeat::Runner
  This allows the hot swapping to work.
  Any drawing should be done on the canvas object, so that OpenGl can easily be switched out for processing/directX/AWESOMEASCIIART/whatever
