= SocialBeat

A proof of concept social crowd beat visualization thing, inspired by Giles Bowkett's RubyFringe talk.

= Install

  gem install ruby-opengl

= Usage

  ruby run.rb artists/simple.rb
  vim artist/simple.rb # Try changing the target color and watch it morph on the fly. oooooooooh.

= Current state

  DONE
  * Hot reloads your artist file

  TODO  
  * Pretty much everything
  * Still needs to be hooked up to rbcoremidi so it can accept MIDI input
  * Canvas::OpenGl needs to be fleshed out so you can actually draw cool stuff

= Architecture

  A subclass of SocialBeat::Artist is instantiated on the fly, as the code file changes.
  This instance is responsible for drawing and update logic. It is totally stateless - any state it wishes to
  keep should be stored in the env variable that is passed to it by SocialBeat::Runner
  This allows the hot swapping to work.
  Any drawing should be done on the canvas object, so that OpenGl can easily be switched out for processing/directX/AWESOMEASCIIART/whatever
